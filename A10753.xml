         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is ſo masked by lying Friers &amp; Popiſh Pilgrims, &amp; ſeditious Seminaries, that the king of Spaine hath ten foiles abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſubiect heares one truth at home. This courſe I haue taken with the Prieſts, becauſe I would diſcover the weakneſſe of poperie to the beſt minded Catholicks: I haue gone home to them to their owne doores, fought with them within their own liſts, at their own weapons, in the preſence of their beſt friends, with their own tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Fathers, Popes, Canons, Texts, and Gloſſes: and if they be foiled at their own weapons, then the beſt minded may ſee the weakneſſe of their owne cauſe.

            <p>GEntlemen:<note place="margin">Rider.</note> the cauſe of this your provoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a quiet and milde conference vpon theſe poſitions,<note place="margin">maiſter W. N.</note> with an honorable Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (and a ſpeciall good friend of yours concerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) wherein he confidently aſſumed, that the Ieſuits and Romane Prieſts of this kingdome, were able to prooue by Scriptures and Fathers, theſe Poſitions to be Apoſtolicall &amp; Catholicque. And that the Church of Rome and the Romane Catholicques in Ireland now hold nothing touching the ſame, but what the holy Scriptures and primitiue Fathers held within the firſt fiue hundred yeares after Chriſts aſcention. Now if you in this conference for your part, haue made ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:3105:9"/>
proofe by the holy canonicall Scriptures, and ſuch Doctors of the Church as aforeſaid, I haue promiſed to become a Roman Catholicque: if you haue failed in your proofe (which I am aſſured you haue done,) he likewiſe before worſhipfull witneſſes hath giuen his hand, to renounce this your new doctrine of the church of Rome, &amp; become a profeſſor of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This was the occaſion and maner of your prouoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which J hope the beſt minded will not miſtake, not you miſconſter, being onelie prouoked by your friend,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15</note> yea &amp; faith (if you refuſe not Saint <hi>Peters</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell) to be readie alwaes to giue an anſwere to anie man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you. In your firſt line you chaunge a woord, (<hi>and</hi> for <hi>or,</hi>) which greatly altereth the Catholickes queſtion, and is farre from our firſt meaning. For we hold with Chriſts trueth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.31.</note> that vnleſſe the written word of God firſt warrant it, we are not bound in conſcience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, though all the Doctors and Prelates in the world ſhould ſweare it. And this was demaunded of you, not as the demaunders doubted that the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures were inſufficient to prooue any article of faith; but onelie, that all men might ſee and ſo be reſolved, whether the Proteſtants, or the now Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholicques ioyne neereſt to Chriſts trueth, and the faith of the firſt primitiue Fathers. For that faith which can bee prooved to bee taught in Chriſts time, and ſo receiued and continued in the primitiue Church for the firſt fiue hundred yeares after Chriſts aſcention, muſt needs be the true, auncient, Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and Catholicque faith. And that other faith that cannot be ſo proved, is but baſe, baſtardly, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; and I truſt in Chriſt, that the Reader eaſily ſhall perceiue before the ende of this ſmall Treatiſe, that this your opinion touching Chriſts carnall preſence in the Sacrament, (and ſo in the reſt of the other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions)
<pb facs="tcp:3105:9"/>
was never taught by Chriſt, nor once dreamed on by the auncient Fathers, but invented and deviled a thouſand yeares after Chriſt, by the late Church of Rome: grounding their proofes onelie of an emptie ſound of ſyllables, without Apoſtolicall or Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licque ſence: enforcing both Scriptures and Fathers to ſpeake what they and you pleaſed, not what the holie Ghoſt and the Fathers purpoſed.</p>
            <p>But firſt, heere you wrong your ſelfe much, your cauſe more, but the ſimple people moſt of all, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſtate of the queſtion: for our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is of the <hi>manner</hi> of Chriſts preſence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whether he be there corporallie or ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.<note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicque Prieſts ſubtilly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtate of the queſtion.</note> And you (no doubt in your conſcience knowing it vnpoſſible to prooue your carnall preſence) alter the queſtion (verie deceiptfully) from the <hi>manner</hi> to the <hi>matter: That Christ is really in the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> A thing never denied by vs, nor ever in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Proteſtant and Papiſt; for both you and we hold Chriſts reall preſence in the Sacrament, but you carnallie and locallie: we miſticallie and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; you by Tranſubſtantiation: we in the commanded and lawfull adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>But here you forget your grounds of divinitie, and rules of Logicke, in making an oppoſition betwixt ſpirituall receiving and reall receiving, oppoſing them as contraries, whereas the oppoſition is not betwixt ſpirituall and reall, but betwixt corporall and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: for ſpirituall receiving by faith is reall receiving, and corporall receiving by the mouth, is alſo reall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving: So that the Scriptures and Fathers that here you alleadge, bee altogither impertinent to prooue your carnall preſence of Chriſt and his new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, of bread; not of the bleſſed Virgin; by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prieſt, not by the holy Ghoſt. For Chriſt willing I will make it plaine vnto you, that you haue ſhewed

For the former part of the verſe, and the later concealed by you, expound Chriſts minde, and bewray your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
               <p>Let me but reaſon with you out of the firſt part of the verſe, from the propertie of this bread heere ſpoken of by Chriſt. Firſt it is living bread, &amp; giues eternall life to the receivers: yours doth not. This came from heaven, yours did not. Who ſo eates of this cannot be damned: but manie eat of yours, and die eternally: and therefore the very properties of this bread ſhew plainely, that it cannot be meant of your ſinging-cakes, as hath beene prooved before vnto you. Becauſe they haue no life in themſelues, and therefore can neither giue life, nor preſerue life vnto others. The later part of the verſe concerneth Chriſts fleſh, which is this true bread. And thus out of Chriſts words I prooue that the fleſh of CHRIST ſpoken of in this place, cannot bee the fleſh of CHRIST which you would haue given in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>Chriſts fleſh promiſed in the ſixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> was onely given on the croſſe: but the Sacrament was not the croſſe. Therfore in the Sacrament the fleſh of Chriſt was not given: So that theſe arguments groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Chriſts owne words which you concealed, confute you &amp; your carnall preſence in the Sacrament,
<pb facs="tcp:3105:17"/>
For your ſacramental bread neither came form heaven, not your imagined fleſh of Chriſt made by the Prieſt cannot be this fleſh here ſpoken of. For it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red once not often as you teach, and that by himſelfe, not by the Prieſts, vpon the croſſe, not in your Maſſe: and that for the plenarie remiſſion of the ſinnes of all beleevers no for the temporall benefit of ſome perticuler perſon, quick, or dead, as the Prieſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>

               <p>But I pray you tell me why you added not the next words of Chriſt? you thought they were againſt you.

               <p>The occaſion whie <hi>Leo</hi> writte this Epiſtle was this: That whereas the errour of the <hi>Manichees</hi> had greatlie infected the Church of God throughout all Chriſtendome:<note place="margin">They deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſts manhood, &amp; taught that his bodie was not a true bodie but a phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie.</note> he in a charitable manner ſent <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> two publike Notaries of the Church of Rome, to the Cleargie and people of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> requeſting them, that ſuch as profeſſed theſe damnable hereſies, might not onelie bee excommunicated from ſermons &amp; ſacraments, but alſo be baniſhed from their Citties for feare of further infection.

And then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in your proofe, which properlie muſt be applied to ſuch hereticks, as denie Chriſt his manhood to bee borne of the bleſſed virgin: and hold that his bodie is not a true bodie, but a phantaſticall bodie, and not to vs that beleeue both.
