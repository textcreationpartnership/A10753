P1. Cor. 10.16.The challice of benediction vvhich vv•• bleſſe,Catho. Prieſtes. is it not the communicConcilium Nicen: cap: 14. Anno: 363.No rule or cuſtome doth permittae, that they which haue not the 
    _ Catho. Prieſts.Concilium Epheſiuum in Epist. ad Neſtorium: Wee approach to the miſticall benedictions, and we are ſanctified,And this had 200. Fathers. being partakers of the holie bodie and precious bloud of Chriſt.

    _ The fleſh is fed by the bodie and bloud of Christ,Catholick Prieſts, Tertullian de reſurrectione caruis, floruit 200. that the ſoule might be fat in God.

    _ And in bleſs vs his flesh to eate, and his bloud to drinke,Catholicke Prieſtes. that we might he nourished by that, by vvhich vve haue been red•emed.

    _ There is no doubt left of the veritie of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, for novv by the aſſurance of our Lord,Caththo• Prieſts. and certaintie of our faith,Hyllarius de Trinitate lib: 4. & 8. floruit: 370. it is his true fleſh and his true bloud.

    _ Catholicks Prieſtes.Nothing remaineth in the vvorld of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt,Athan: lib. de Paſſione Imaginis Chriſts cap. 7. florni•: 375. but that vvhich daylie is made by the Prieſt on the Altar.

    _ Catho. Prieſts. Damaſcen lib. 4 de fide orthod. cap. 14. floruit. 391.Let vs approach in ardent faith, laying our hands in manner of a croſſe, and let vs receiue the bodie of him that vvas crucified.

    _ This bread is bread before the conſecration: but when it is conſecrated, of bread it is made the flesh of Chriſt.Ambr. de ſacrament•s, lib 4 cap. 4. fl•ruit. 40•

    _ Not onelie the Sacrament, but the bodie of Chriſt is propounded vnto vs, not that vve ſhould touch is onely,Chriſoſt. hom. 51. in cap. 4. Math. floruis. 410. but that vve ſhould eate it.

    _ Catho. Prieſts.We ought rather to beleeue in Chriſt, and humbly to learn of him,Carill in Ioh. lib. 4. cap. 13. floruit. Anno. 423 then like drunken ſots to crie out, hovv can he giue vs his flesh?

    _ The bread vvhich deſcended from heaven is the bodie of our Lord, and the wine he gaue his diſciples is his bloud.Catho. Prieſts.

    _ The mediator betvvixt God and man Ieſus Chriſt, vvith faithfull heart and mouth vve receiue,Auguſt. contra Aduerſar. legis & prophetarum: cap. 9. floruit 430. giving vs his flesh to eate and his bloud to drinke. Although it ſeeme more horrible to eate the flesh of man then to kill: and to drinke the bloud of man then to sheed it.

    _ In vvhat darkneſſe of ignorance, in vvhat ſluggiſh careleſneſſe, haue they been?Leo epiſt. 22. ad Clerum & plebem Conſtantinopolitanae vrbis floruit Anno. 466. as not to haue heard by beareſay, nor by reading to haue found, vvhich in the Church of God is ſo plaine, as that the mouthes of children do tell, the bodie and bloud of Chriſt to be trulie in the bleſſed ſacrament.

    _ Thus much for the fathers, as a skantling or taſte, leaving the ſurplus to the curious Reader. I might haue recited Martial Epiſt. ad Rurd•galenſes, cap. 3. Anaclet. Epiſt. general: Dioniſius Arcop. cap. 3. page. 3. vvho lived vvithin the compaſſe of the firſt hundred yeares:I thinke your meaning vvas 500 years, otherwiſe it cannot be true. but I obſerueI praie you obſerue veritie. brevitie, as by the next proofe ſhall appeare.

    _ The third proofe. That the chiefe Protestants did beleeue the reall preſence,Catho. Prieſts. and alleadged all the Fathers for the maintenance thereof.

    _ Amongſt factions of opinions,Catho. Prieſts. Magdeburg. in Epiſt. ad Eliz. Anglia Reg. Rider. ſome latelie take avvay the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, touching his reall preſence. contrarie to the moſt plaine, moſt evident, and puiſſant vvords of Chriſt.

    _ Tyndall, Frith. Barnes, Cranmer, left it as a thing indifferent to beleeue the reall preſence.Catho. Prieſts. So that the adoration (ſaith Frith) be taken avvay, becauſe there then remaineth no poiſon,Fox in Mar•yrel. Kemnitius in Exam. Conc. •rid contra ••n de F•. ch•ristia. vvhereof anie ought to be afraid of. Yet Kemnitius vpon the aſſurance of the reall preſence, approoveth the cuſtome of the Church, in adoring Chriſt in the Sacrament by the authoritie of Saint Auguſtine, and S. Ambroſe, in Pſal 98. Euſebius Emiſſenus, &c. Saint Gregorie Nazianzen: and ſaith it is impietie to doe the contrarie. So that the brood being of ſuch agreement vve haue the leſſe occaſion to embuſie our braines to confute them.

    _ The fourth proofe. Deniers of the reall preſence condemned as heretickes.Catho. Prieſts.

    _ The fift proofe.Catho. Prieſts. Of manie miraculous teſtimonies of the reall preſence.

    _ Euſebius recounteth,Catho. Prieſts. lib. 5. cap. 1. that in the perſecution vnder Severe, that it vvas a great accuſation againſt Christians, that they did eate mans fleſh, becauſe they beleeved that they did receiue the bodie of Chriſt.
